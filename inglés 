 * Done! Once installed, you can open Visual Studio Code and start using it.
After installation, you can customize it with extensions for various programming languages, themes, and additional functionalities as needed.


dream trip to Japan

This trip will be more than just a holiday. It will be a really, really exciting chance for me. I want to experience a place that I find very interesting. This is because it has big social differences, which makes me curious.
If I can make this dream come true, it will be a very good and special experience for me. It will allow me to explore a new culture. This culture makes my imagination work a lot â€“ more than any other place I know. I really want to see and learn about it.
